1 Overview
==========

  The foam-extend project is a fork of the OpenFOAM® open source library
  for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). It is an open project
  welcoming and integrating contributions from all users and
  developers. Previously known as OpenFOAM-dev and OpenFOAM-extend, it
  contains bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as extensions
  and additional features provided by community contributors (see file
  ListOfContributors), such as dynamic mesh and topological change
  support, turbomachinery extensions including general grid
  interpolation (GGI), cyclic GGI and mixing plane, block-coupled matrix
  support, implicitly coupled conjugate heat transfer and other physics
  coupling, finite area method, comprehensive dynamic mesh (motion and
  topological changes) capability and GPU support. For a full list, see
  below and previous release notes at:
  [http://sourceforge.net/p/openfoam-extend/wiki/Home/]

  Version 3.2, nicknamed "Ann Arbor", is the current version of
  foam-extend. The release continues the tradition and spirit of the
  original FOAM code developed by prof. Jasak and Mr. Weller during
  their time at Imperial College and released as the general purpose
  CFD/CCM package by Nabla Ltd. in 2000. In this spirit, we reverted 18
  December 2013 to the original numbering scheme (foam-2.3.2, 13
  December 2004) as release number 3.0.  Visit [http://foam-extend.org]
  for more information.

  foam-extend are a community effort not endorsed by ESI Group.

3 Compatibility
===============

  Upstream features from the OpenFOAM® code base are merged into
  foam-extend on regular basis. The interface format of foam-extend-3.2
  is largely compatible to foam-extend-3.1, to OpenFOAM-1.6-ext and
  OpenFOAM-1.7.x. In some cases, the differences are caused by bug fixes
  and algorithmic improvements, considered more important than
  inter-operability.


4 Main differentiators between foam-extend and OpenFOAM
=======================================================

  A large number of features have been lost within the release of
  OpenFOAM since version 1.3, the code base has shrunk by more than 40%.
  While we understand the lack of technical ability of supporting
  advanced CFD features, we feel that existing features and specifically
  large-scale contributions should remain active and developed
  further. Below is a list of main features of foam-extend which are
  lacking, lost, deactivated or unusable in ESI releases:

  * Turbomachinery features, including General Grid Interface (GGI),
    partial overlap GGI, cyclic GGI, with improvements in parallel
    scaling.  First release of a mixing plane stage interface

  * Dynamic mesh with topological changes Sliding interfaces, mesh
    layering, attach-detach boundaries etc.  In foam-extend, full
    parallel support for topological changes is released for the first
    time

  * Finite Element Method with support for polyhedral meshes This is
    mainly used in mesh deformation and over the last 15 years it has
    proven vastly superior to all other dynamic mesh methods.

  * Advanced mesh deformation technology Including tet FEM mesh
    deformation, Radial Basis Function (RBF) mesh deformation,
    tetrahedral remeshing dynamic mesh support and solid body motion
    functions.  All of the above include parallelisation support

  * Library of dynamic meshes with topological changes with full second
    order FVM discretisation support on moving meshes with topological
    changes

  * Internal combustion engine-specific dynamic mesh classes such as
    two-stroke engine and various forms of 4-stroke and multi-valve
    dynamic mesh classes

  * Finite Area Method providing support for FVM-like discretisation on
    a curved surface in 3-D, with examples of liquid film modeling

  * Block-coupled matrix support, allowing fully implicit multi-equation
    solution of NxN equation sets, with full parallelisation support.
    First release of a block-AMG linear equation solver

  * Fully implicit conjugate-coupled solution framework, allowing
    implicit solution fo multiple equations over multiple meshes, with
    parallelism

  * Proper Orthogonal Decomposition data analysis tools, with
    applications to FOAM field classes

  * Equation reader classes and tutorials

  * Multi-solver solution framework, allowing multiple field models to
    be solved in a coupled manner

  * A major contribution is solid mechanics modelling, including linear
    and non-linear materials, contact, self-contact and friction, with
    updated Lagrangian or absolute Lagrangian formulation.  Solution of
    damage models and crack propagation in complex materials via
    topological changes

  * CUDA solver release, provided in full source and as an example of
    coupling external linear equation solvers with FOAM

  * Library-level support for Immersed Boundary Method and Overset Mesh

  * Major improvements in accuracy and stability of FVM discretisation
    with options on convection and diffusion discretisation, deferred
    correction or explicit schemes

  * Algebraic multigrid solver framework

  * 243 tutorials with automated run scripts

  * Automatic test harness

  * Approximately 6000 bug fixes in fundamental level libraries and
    discretisation techniques
